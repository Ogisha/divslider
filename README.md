Section slider v.0.8b

made by: Ogisha (pandurevic.o@gmail.com) using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript/MongoDB

JS notes:
- ES5, ES6
- Meteor as framework and the structure
- React.js as templating library
- jQuery - for some (but just a little bit of) animations and instant DOM manipulation (old habits die hard... )
- no external scripts or borrowed functionality!

features (overall):
- integrated db where a user can enter, save and query the task related data
- overall responsiveness and simple access on all resolutions and screen sizes
- menus that are animated and easily accessed


features (on large screens):
- fully reactive display customization (that includes display by the current status of the 
task and, also, the display by the requested number of columns)
- note: user can pick a row structure on big screens only - no use for this on tablets, right? :-)

features (on smaller displays):
- customized display for mobile screens
- pagination
- note for testing/demonstration purposes: the switch between the displays doesn't happen on resize (purpose is 
understandable, I believe) but on the load (even more understandable, since you wouldn't toggle 
displays/resize screens in real time :-))
